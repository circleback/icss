module Receiver

  #
  # Makes a Receiver thingie behave mostly like a hash.
  #
  # By default, the hashlike methods iterate over the receiver attributes:
  # instance #keys delegates to self.class.keys which calls
  # receiver_attr_names. If you want to filter our add to the keys list, you
  # can just override the class-level keys method (and call super, or not):
  #
  #     def self.keys
  #       super + [:firstname, :lastname] - [:fullname]
  #     end
  #
  # All methods are defined naturally on [], []= and has_key? -- if you enjoy
  #
  #
  # in addition to the below, by including Enumerable, this also adds
  #
  #   #to_a (#entries), #all?, #any?, #collect (#map), #detect (#find),
  #   #each_with_index, find_all (#select), #grep, #inject, #max, #min,
  #   #partition, #reject, sort, #sort_by, and #zip. (and perhaps more)
